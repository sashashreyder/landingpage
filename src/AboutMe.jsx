            designing little projects just for fun. Back then, I dreamed of becoming a programmer. 
            But because I struggled with math in school, everyone told me it wasnâ€™t realistic. 
            So, I chose more humanities-focused paths in education.`,

However, the pandemic changed everything. 
            I managed to keep the bar running for two more years, but the challenges became too overwhelming.
